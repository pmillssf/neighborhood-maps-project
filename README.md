### Intro
This is a neighborhood map of San Francisco, displaying five points of interest along with
a link to their wikipedia article. One location doesn't have a wikipedia page, so it links
to their website instead.

#### Set up
Download the repo, and open index.html in a browser with an internet connection, everything
should be self explanatory to anyone familiar with Google Maps and how to operate a dropdown
menu.
